Hello everyone.

### Algorithm

My maze solution uses the right hand rule, which has a very simple algorithm in terms of real-world traversal.

The rule of the right hand determines that a person in the maze must stretch his right hand to the wall and move behind this wall without taking his hand off the wall.

### Algorithm defect

One of the drawbacks is that the right-hand rule will not be able to traverse intertwined mazes (mazes that have circular branches, etc.)
